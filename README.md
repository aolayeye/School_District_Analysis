# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
This project analyzes data from a variety of sources and a variety of formats from a city school district. Our analysis will prepare all standardized test data for anaysis, reporting and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns. These insights are used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and dsitrict level about school budget and priorities. This analysis provided shines a light on student funding as well as students standardized test scores.

Further to our analysis, we are investigating eveidence of academic dishonesty in he students data provide in the students_complete.csv file; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards.  Our analysis will thus aim to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. We would then repeat the analysis the school district analysis and show the changes affected the overall analysis.

At the end of our analysis we will be able to provide insights on the following questions:
  - How is the district summary affected?
  - How is the school summary affected?
  - How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
  - How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
  - Scores by school spending
  - Scores by school size
  - Scores by school type
