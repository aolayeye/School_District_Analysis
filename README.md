# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
This project analyzes data from a variety of sources and a variety of formats from a city school district. Our analysis will prepare all standardized test data for anaysis, reporting and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns. These insights are used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and dsitrict level about school budget and priorities. This analysis provided shines a light on student funding as well as students standardized test scores.

The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked you to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once youâ€™ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
